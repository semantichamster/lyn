## Heal Our Heroes Backoffice Automation Project
##### Hackathon Austin Oct 18-19, 2014 sponsored by eBay, Inc.
## Heal Our Heroes Project Mission

Their mission is to help military families reconnect after deployments through 5-day/4-night recreational therapeutic retreats. The five day retreats give the soldier and their family memberâ€™s adequate time to begin to decompress and begin the healing cycle.

Heal Our Heroes based in Texas and Project Sanctuary based in Colorado are the only two organizations focused
on helping military families reconnect through recreational therapeutic retreats. These two organizations
share resources and use the same web hosting and maintenance firm.


## Goals of Opportunity Hack Austin Backoffice Automation Project

1. Perform a Business Opportunity Assessment of Heal Our Heroes Project
2. Identify Backoffice Automation Opportunities to increase productivity
3. Create a Low Maintenance Cloud Based Backoffice Automation Architecture
4. Prototype a Proof of Concept for Retreat Staffing and Planning
5. Create a roadmap for recruiting volunteers to operationalize the Proof of Concept

## Business Opportunity Challenges

1. Manual Retreat Scheduling/Planning Logistics is paper driven and won't scale
2. Web Site generating WebMail logistic emails won't scale.
3. Email automation is needed for Donor, Retreat Attendees, Volunteers, and Supporters
4. Automated Donor Metrics are needed for funding proposals to justify doubling retreats
5. Backoffice Automation should support increased brand awareness

## Backoffice Automation Architecture

* Replace Website Generated Web mails with Google Forms links
* Create a "dbms" in Google Docs Spreadsheet to automate Retreat Staffing/planning
* Email lists will be managed from Spreadsheet

## Retreat Staffing/Planning Proof of Concept

- RetreatManager Google Spreadsheet for managing volunteers and families
- VolunteerAvailability Google Form for collecting timing information
- VolunteerContactInfo Google Form
- VolunteerBackGroundCheck Google Form
- FamilyEnrollment Google Form

### End of Hackathon Austin Effort

## Operationalize Proof of Concept
- Work with Staff to populate RetreatManager spreadsheet
- Email volunteers from spreadsheet
- Email families from spreadshhet
- Perform time motion study to quantify time saved which can be shifted to fundraising

## Make Operationalized Proof of Concept Sustainable
1. Approach ATX Hackerspace and Austin Pair Programming to extend github repo
2. Ask for Volunteers to write JS scripts to scrape webmails for 1500 retreat requests
3. Write Donor reports from 1500 family backlogs information
