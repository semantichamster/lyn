# **Heal Our Heroes Backoffice Automation Project**

===

## Heal Our Heroes Project Mission

Their mission is to help military families reconnect after deployments through 5-day/4-night recreational therapeutic retreats. The five day retreats give the soldier and their family memberâ€™s adequate time to begin to decompress and begin the healing cycle.

Heal Our Heroes based in Texas and Project Sanctuary based in Colorado are the only two organizations focused
on helping military families reconnect through recreational therapeutic retreats. These two organizations
share resources and use the same web hosting and maintenance firm.
